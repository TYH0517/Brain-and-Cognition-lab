I recently graduated from the PhD program in Neuroscience of Consciousness and Cognition held at the Graduate Institute of Mind, Brain and Consciousness and under the supervision of Dr Tzu-Yu Hsu.

My thesis focused on the role that the Prefrontal Parietal Network plays in reports of conscious perception. Particularly, I used TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) to study how the dorsolateral prefrontal and the posterior parietal cortices affect our metacognitive insights. Dr TzuYu Hsu and I also explored how prestimulus alpha band activity is related to both reports of visibility of a stimulus and reports of decision confidence.

After completing my BSc in Psychology my main academic interest has been the neuropsychology of access consciousness and its deficits (i.e., agnosias). Thanks to my MSc in Research Methodology for the Social and Health Sciences, I also have a very strong interest in the prediction of voting behaviours through the creation of forecasting models.
