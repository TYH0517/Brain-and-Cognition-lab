I’m Risa Dwi Ratnasari, I have graduated from the Master’s program from GIMBC. Currently, I work as a teaching and research assistant at Padjadjaran University (Unpad) Indonesia. I joined
Tzu-Yu Lab in 2020 – 2021 as a student, and continued on as a research assistant through the second half of 2021. During my postgraduate studies, I was involved in a project related to the
role of self-thought or rumination. In this research, I used an experimental study approach which focused on observations on behavioral performance and continued with brain wave
investigations with EEG. Dr Hsu and I focused on developing experimental designs to measure rumination tendencies using cognitive tasks. This research is an exploratory study to find out
the pattern between certain thought tendencies and a conditioned task. I applied ERP (Event Related Potential) analysis to observe brain waves on participants during task-performance.
From the research experience I obtained from Dr Hsu’s Lab, I was inspired to continue research in behavioral assessment methods for crisis conditions as experienced by people.
