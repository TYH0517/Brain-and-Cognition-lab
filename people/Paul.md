Hello There! I am Paul Cheng, a Ph.D. student studying at Taipei Medical University Graduate Institute of Mind, Brain, and consciousness(GIMBC).  Joined Professor Tzu-Yu Hsu at Brain, Cognition, and Consciousness lab (BCC) in 2017 to research the topic of self and depression using neuroimaging techniques.  Since the inception of my academic career, I have been fascinated by our ability to introspect and be subjectively aware of our sensations and perceptions.  Tools such as religious and philosophical methods use mediation, or dialectical discussion gave us an inkling to describe the self. Our understanding of the self and its functionality is still the frontier of scientific discovery, which I hope to develop my understanding.  In addition to my research project, I am a python program enthusiast who advocates for open source and open science. I hope to contribute and collaborate on developing robust and reproducible research tools.
