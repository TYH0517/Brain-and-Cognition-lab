My overall research interest concerns how we live adaptively in the world. The two aspects that I have been working on are predictions and decision making. Humans are able to learn the structures of the environment by extracting relevant information. This facilitates predictions of upcoming events which lets us be adaptive in the world. My approach involves studying some computational models that can show insights of possible computations in our brains and whether they connect to behavioral or electrophysiological data. 
For decision making, I am interested in the topic of “explore-exploit dilemma.” The dilemma refers to a situation where an agent is confronted with whether to choose a well known option whose reward outcomes are familiar or to choose an unknown option that one has no experience with and thus has the potential to be something even better. The dilemma occurs because our needs for information and rewards are conflicting with each other. Many everyday life problems such as choosing a meal or thinking about a career path require us to determine whether to explore or to exploit is the optimal decision. How to strike a balance between gaining more information and maximizing rewards is thus an important problem for all of us to live adaptively in the world.
